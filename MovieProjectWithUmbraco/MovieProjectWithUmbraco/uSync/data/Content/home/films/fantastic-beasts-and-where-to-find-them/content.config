  <plot><![CDATA[<p>In 1926, British wizard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them#About_Newt_Scamander" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Newt Scamander</a> arrives by boat to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> en route to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman ("No-Maj" or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">muggle</a>") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society, which claims that witches and wizards are real and dangerous. As Newt listens to her speak, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Beasts" title="Magical creatures in Harry Potter">Niffler</a> escapes from his magically-expanded suitcase, which houses multiple magical creatures. As he attempts to capture it, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski and they accidentally swap suitcases. Demoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auror" title="Auror" class="mw-redirect">Auror</a> Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, President Seraphina Picquery and Director of the Magical Security Percival Graves dismiss the case. At Jacob's apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.</p>
<p>Graves approaches Credence Barebone, Mary Lou's adopted son, and offers to free him from his abusive mother in exchange for his finding the host of an Obscurus, a dark, destructive force inadvertently manifested by young magical children forced to conceal their powers. The force can be unleashed during periods of anger and stress; Graves believes that it has caused several mysterious destructive incidents around the city.</p>
<p>After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Legilimency_and_Occlumency" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Legilimens</a> sister. Queenie and Jacob are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to marry No-Majs or interact with them. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically-expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained Obscurus that Newt recently extracted from a girl who died. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After re-capturing two of the three escaped beasts, they re-enter the suitcase, which Tina takes to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> Henry Shaw Jr., and decide to destroy Newt's suitcase and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obliviate" title="Obliviate" class="mw-redirect">obliviate</a> Jacob's memory. Graves interrogates Newt and Tina and accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Dark_Arts" title="Magic in Harry Potter">dark wizard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supporting_Harry_Potter_characters#Gellert_Grindelwald" title="List of supporting Harry Potter characters">Gellert Grindelwald</a>. Newt and Tina are immediately sentenced to death, but they escape and meet up with Queenie and Jacob; the foursome then capture the last of the creatures after receiving a tip from the goblin gangster Gnarlack.</p>
<p>Credence finds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Wand" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">wand</a> under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes the wand is Credence's, but Modesty claims it is hers. When she is about to be punished, the Obscurus is unleashed, killing everyone except Modesty and Credence. Graves arrives and dismisses Credence as being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe_of_Harry_Potter#Squibs" title="Fictional universe of Harry Potter">Squib</a> (a non-magical person of wizard ancestry), and refuses to tutor him in magic after they enter Modesty's biological family's home. Credence then reveals himself as the host of the Obscurus, the real cause of Shaw's death, and unleashes it upon the city in a rage.</p>
<p>In a subway tunnel, Newt talks to Credence but is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him instead. As Credence begins to settle into human form, Picquery arrives with Aurors and decides Credence's life must be forfeited to keep the existence of magic hidden. The Aurors apparently disintegrate him, but Newt notices a tiny wisp of the Obscurus fleeing. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. He repels the Aurors but is subdued by one of Newt's beasts and revealed to be Gellert Grindelwald in disguise. Grindelwald is then taken into custody by MACUSA Aurors.</p>
<p>MACUSA fears it is too late to protect their secret world, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a potion over the city via a downpour that will erase all New Yorkers' recent memories. MACUSA wizards repair the destruction, and Jacob reluctantly agrees to let himself be obliviated as well. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories. Newt departs for Europe, but promises to return and visit Tina once he finishes his book; he also anonymously leaves Jacob a case of Occamy eggshells (made of silver), allowing Jacob to fulfil his dream of opening his own bakery. His breads and pastries are unknowingly inspired by Newt's creatures, and Queenie visits him in his shop.</p>]]></plot>
