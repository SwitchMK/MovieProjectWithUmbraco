  <content><![CDATA[<p>Lucasfilm and Disney have just launched their first non-saga film in <em><a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/star-wars-rogue-one/">Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</a></em> to outstanding results. As fun of a singular story it was, it being out in theaters currently means that <strong><em><a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/star-wars-8/">Star Wars: Episode VIII</a></em></strong> is next up on the docket. Even with it being just under a year away, anticipation for the film is high as <em>Star Wars</em> fans around the world wait to see what happens with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) upon their encounter. Rey was able to find the secluded Jedi on Ahch-To in <em>Episode VII – The Force Awakens</em> (after R2-D2 and BB-8 completed the map leading to him), and immediately offered him back his lightsaber upon finding him.</p>
<p>The ending to <em><a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/star-wars-7/">Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens</a></em> left audiences wanting to see what’s next, but they should have the chance to see it come <em>Episode VIII</em>. While it appeared as though Luke was completely alone on the island before Rey arrived, a new rumor suggests that is not the case and audiences will get to see Luke’s animal friends next year.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://makingstarwars.net/2016/12/rumors-star-wars-episode-viii-and-the-protectors-of-ahch-to/" target="_blank">Making Star Wars</a></em> is reporting that <em>Episode VIII</em> will reveal two different creatures that have befriended Luke during his stay on Ahch-To and permitted him to remain there. The first is described as a combination between a puffin bird and a Furby or Gremlin mixed with <em>Star Wars</em>. The bird like creatures will have razor sharp teeth and see themselves as <em>“the protector of the island(s) on Ahch-To.”</em> These are the ones that will actually be featured alongside Luke, but it will be Rey that encounters and battles a <em>“rather large sea monster”</em> in an effort to prove she is worthy to stay on the island.</p>]]></content>
