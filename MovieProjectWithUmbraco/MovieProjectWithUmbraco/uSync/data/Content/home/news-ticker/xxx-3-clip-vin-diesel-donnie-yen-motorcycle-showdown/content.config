  <content><![CDATA[<p>We live in a era of franchises, where practically every film released does so with the hopes of jump-starting its own series. Next year, Vin Diesel will take part in three separate franchises: starring in <em><a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/fast-and-furious-8/">Fate of the Furious</a></em>, voicing Groot in <a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2/"><em>Guardian of the Galaxy Vol. 2</em></a>, and returning as Xander Cage for <strong><em><a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/xxx-3/">xXx: Return of Xander Cage</a></em></strong>. More of a sequel to<em> xXx</em> than the forgettable<em> xXx: State of the Union</em> (in where Cage was killed off screen and replaced by Ice Cube’s Darius Stone), <em>xXx: Return of Xander Cage</em> will “resurrect” Diesel’s character and see him assemble his own team of thrill seekers for a covert government mission.</p>
<p>That mission will pit Cage against Donnie Yen’s villainous Xiang as both try to reclaim a mysterious but powerful weapon known only as “Pandora’s Box.” Already a superstar in Hong Kong, Yen is currently enjoying a moment in the spotlight thanks to his role as Chirrute Îmwe in <em><a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/star-wars-rogue-one/">Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</a></em>. And following that film up with <em>Return of Xander Cage</em> might just be another breakout hit, gaining him more popularity stateside like other martial artists/actors such as Jackie Chan and Jet Li (who Yen actually replaced on this film after Li dropped out).</p>
<p>Having Yen involved should also only boost the caliber of <em>Return of Xander Cage</em>‘s action and fights scenes, giving this <em>xXx</em> sequel the edge it needs to establish itself as a hit action franchise. You can check out a clip above in which Diesel’s Cage and Yen’s Xiang race atop some suped-up motorbikes in what looks like a thrilling chase sequence.</p>
<p>In addition to the new clip, there’s also a new trailer for <em>xXx: Return of Xander Cage</em> that focuses on one of Cage’s new recruits, Kris Wu’s Harvard “Nicks”. You can give that trailer a watch, below.</p>
<p>Similar to an earlier trailer that featured <a href="http://screenrant.com/xxx-3-ruby-rose-trailer/">Ruby Rose’s Adele Wolff</a>, this one also plays up the ensemble feel that <em>xXx: Return of Xander Cage</em> is aiming for. Where the first <em>xXx</em> film focused on Cage as more of a lone wolf who was sought out for his special skills and risk-taking attitude, this film is definitely pulling a page or two out of the the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> formula.</p>
<p>While that doesn’t necessarily mean that <em>Return of Xander Cage</em> will have as compelling an ensemble as the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> films do, more allies for Cage to work with will certainly allow for more extravagant stunts – and really, that’s the selling point of a <em>xXx</em> film, something this sequel seems to definitely understand.</p>]]></content>
