  <content><![CDATA[<p>20th Century Fox continue to build-up to the premiere of the first trailer for <a href="http://screenrant.com/tag/alien-covenant/"><strong><em>Alien: Covenant</em></strong></a> – director Ridley Scott’s sequel to <em>Prometheus</em> that (according to the movie’s <a href="http://screenrant.com/alien-covenant-prometheus-2-release-date-2017/">official synopsis</a>) <em>“connects directly”</em> to the filmmaker’s landmark 1979 sci-fi/horror film, <em>Alien</em>. The images that Fox has been releasing from <em>Covenant</em> on a daily basis over the past week (at the time of writing this) have further played up the idea that this new movie has a more explicit connection to <em>Alien</em> than the quasi-prequel <em>Prometheus</em> does, drawing inspiration from <a href="http://screenrant.com/alien-covenant-corridor-hr-giger-design/">iconic imagery</a> and elements in the previous installments of the <em>Alien</em> franchise (<a href="http://screenrant.com/alien-covenant-image-colonial-marines/">films and even video games alike</a>).</p>
<p>The story this time around concerns the crew of the spaceship Covenant, a team of space explorers that finds their way to <a href="http://screenrant.com/alien-covenant-photos-baby-neomorphs-temples/">a dark and dangerous world</a> (believed to be the home planet of humankind’s creators, aka. the Engineers) that appears to have but one living inhabitant: the android David (Michael Fassbender), who was last seen in <em>Prometheus</em> with his head still detached from his body. However, as fate would have it, the crew of the Covenant are accompanied by a <a href="http://screenrant.com/alien-covenant-michael-fassbender-androids/">Fassbender-bot of their own</a>.</p>
<p>Fassbender himself has confirmed that this other android in <em>Alien: Covenant</em> is named Walter, though details beyond that are being kept under-wraps for now. The official <em>Alien</em> Anthology <a href="https://twitter.com/AlienAnthology/status/812317396262232064?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account has now released an image from <em>Covenant</em> that presumably shows Walter, not David, dressed all in white and sitting down in front of a piano… though, it could instead be David who’s pictured here. It’s also worth noting that unlike other recent <em>Covenant</em> images that have been tweeted out, this one doesn’t include a mysterious string of numbers. (Next up then – the trailer?)</p>]]></content>
