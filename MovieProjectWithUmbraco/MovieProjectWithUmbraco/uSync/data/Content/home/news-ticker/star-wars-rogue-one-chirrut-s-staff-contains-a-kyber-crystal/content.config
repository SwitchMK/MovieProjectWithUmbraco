  <content><![CDATA[<p>There are several memorable characters in <em><strong>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</strong></em>, including reprogrammed <a href="http://screenrant.com/k-2so-rogue-one-star-wars-droid-trivia-facts/">Imperial droid K-2SO</a>, Rebel extremist <a href="http://screenrant.com/rogue-one-saw-gerrera-clone-wars/">Saw Gerrera</a> and Guardian of the Whills <a href="http://screenrant.com/star-wars-rogue-one-donnie-yen-passed/">Chirrut Îmwe</a>. Though the scope of the film limited the screen time available to some of these characters, others stayed in the focus for almost the entire film.</p>
<p>As it turns out, one of the characters was carrying a little secret with him the whole time. As some fans speculated, it’s now been confirmed that the end of Chirrut’s staff contained a little bit of the material that the Empire was seeking out in droves…<a href="http://screenrant.com/star-wars-kyber-lightsaber-crystals-trivia-facts/"> kyber crystal</a>.</p>
<p>The bit of kyber in Chirrut’s staff is never actually seen in the film, but its presence is confirmed by the book <em>Star Wars Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide</em> by Pablo Hidalgo. The glowing metal end of his staff is referred to as the “crystal containment lamp” and contains both a “sliver” of kyber crystal and a battery to power the light within. The lamp is described in the book as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Designed as a symbolic source of inner illumination, it also allows Chirrut to better gauge where the end of the staff is, as he can hear both the battery and crystal harmonic.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This in part explains Chirrut’s combat abilities, since the two sounds within the lamp let him have a much better idea of where that end of his staff is at any time. Listening for sounds made by enemies (as showcased in his first fight scene) provides him with a target that he can then drive the staff toward. The idea that he can hear the harmonics of kyber crystal also explain him knowing that Jyn was wearing a necklace, since he could hear the crystal on the necklace itself.</p>
<p>The symbolism of Chirrut having a sliver of crystal in his staff is interesting, too, especially since some had speculated at one point that the “lamp” may have been a lightsaber component. Chirrut is not a Jedi, but he could still be seen as a warrior monk; as it’s kyber that is used in lightsabers to create the blade, him having just a sliver of kyber could be a parallel between his role as a Guardian of the Whills and early speculation about him being a Jedi. In a <a href="http://screenrant.com/star-wars-rogue-one-jedi-rebels/">film without Jedi</a>, it’s interesting to see how much of a role both kyber and <a href="http://screenrant.com/rogue-one-what-role-does-the-force-have-in-a-movie-with-no-jedi/">the Force itself</a> still played.</p>
<p>Some fans may have been disappointed that Chirrut didn’t wind up being a blind former Jedi in the end, but this likely worked out for the best. Showing him as a monk who could sense the Force (but not actively use it) and who very much viewed the Force as more of a religion than a tool was a refreshing shift from the <em>Star Wars</em> status quo, and it’s nice to see that these sorts of <a href="http://screenrant.com/rogue-one-saw-gerrera-darth-vader-similarities/">parallels between characters</a> can exist in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe without there being an explicit need to include every aspect of the previous films.</p>]]></content>
