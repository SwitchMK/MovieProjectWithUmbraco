My father's parents ran a department store in Bangor, Maine, and my mother's father was a cabinetmaker. [...] People with those roots are not inclined to be lazy."</p>
<p>In 1948, the Williams family moved to Los Angeles where John attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_High_School" title="North Hollywood High School">North Hollywood High School</a> graduating in 1950.

<p>In 1974, director Steven Spielberg approached Williams to compose the music for his feature directorial debut, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a>.

Williams never met Fiedler in person but spoke with him by telephone. His arrival as the Pops' new leader in the spring of 1980 allowed him to devote part of the Pops' first PBS broadcast of the season to presenting his new compositions for The Empire Strikes Back. Williams almost ended his tenure with the Pops in 1984.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> Considered a customary practice of opinion, some players hissed while sight-reading a new Williams composition in rehearsal; Williams abruptly left the session and turned in his resignation. He initially cited mounting conflicts with his film composing schedule, but later admitted a perceived lack of discipline in, and respect from, the Pops' ranks, culminating in this latest instance. After entreaties by the management and personal apologies from the musicians, Williams withdrew his resignation and continued as principal conductor for nine more years.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams#cite_note-NYT2_JW-61">[61]</a></sup> In 1995, he was succeeded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Lockhart" title="Keith Lockhart">Keith Lockhart</a>, the former associate conductor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Symphony_Orchestra" title="Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra">Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Pops_Orchestra" title="Cincinnati Pops Orchestra">Cincinnati Pops Orchestra</a>.</span></p>
