  <fullName><![CDATA[Rupert Alexander Lloyd Grint]]></fullName>
  <biography><![CDATA[<p>Grint was born in Harlow, Essex, England, to Nigel Grint (b. 1963), a dealer in racing memorabilia, and Joanne Grint (née Parsons; b. 1967). Grint is the eldest of five siblings. He has stated that his earliest goal in life was to become an ice cream man. He attended Richard Hale School, in Hertford.<br />While in school, Grint took an avid interest in theatre. He started performing in school productions and joined the Top Hat Stage and Screen School, a local theatre group that cast him as a fish in Noah's Ark and a donkey in another nativity play. He continued performing in school plays as he moved into secondary school. However, Grint had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series.<br />At the age of 16, he left school to focus on his acting career. "I didn't really like school that much," the actor later commented.</p>]]></biography>
