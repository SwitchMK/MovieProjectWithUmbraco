  <history><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span id="History" class="mw-headline">History</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Universal Studios was founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Laemmle" title="Carl Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a>, Mark Dintenfass, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_O_Baumann" title="Charles O Baumann" class="mw-redirect">Charles O. Baumann</a>, Adam Kessel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Powers_(businessman)" title="Pat Powers (businessman)">Pat Powers</a>, William Swanson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Horsley" title="David Horsley">David Horsley</a>, Robert H. Cochrane<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-3">[a]</a></sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Brulatour" title="Jules Brulatour">Jules Brulatour</a>. One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours, counting patrons and calculating the day's takings. Within weeks of his Chicago trip, Laemmle gave up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_goods" title="Dry goods">dry goods</a> to buy the first several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_(movie_theater)" title="Nickelodeon (movie theater)">nickelodeons</a>. For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs, the creation in 1908 of the Edison-backed Motion Picture Trust meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed. Based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latham_Loop" title="Latham Loop" class="mw-redirect">Latham Loop</a> used in cameras and projectors, along with other patents, the Trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition, and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution.</p>
<p>Soon, Laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying Edison by producing their own pictures. In June 1909, Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Stern" title="Abe Stern">Abe Stern</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Stern_(producer)" title="Julius Stern (producer)">Julius Stern</a>. That company quickly evolved into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Moving_Pictures" title="Independent Moving Pictures">Independent Moving Pictures Company</a> (IMP), with studios in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee,_New_Jersey" title="Fort Lee, New Jersey">Fort Lee, New Jersey</a>, where many early films in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_first_motion_picture_industry" title="America's first motion picture industry" class="mw-redirect">America's first motion picture industry</a> were produced in the early 20th century.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-4">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-5">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-6">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-7">[6]</a></sup> Laemmle broke with Edison's custom of refusing to give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billing_(filmmaking)" title="Billing (filmmaking)">billing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_credits" title="Motion picture credits">screen credits</a> to performers. By naming the movie stars, he attracted many of the leading players of the time, contributing to the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system_(filmmaking)" title="Star system (filmmaking)">star system</a>. In 1910, he promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Lawrence" title="Florence Lawrence">Florence Lawrence</a>, formerly known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Biograph_Girl" title="The Biograph Girl">The Biograph Girl</a>", and actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Baggot" title="King Baggot">King Baggot</a>, in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing.</p>
<p>The Universal Film Manufacturing Company was incorporated in New York on April 30, 1912.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-8">[7]</a></sup> Laemmle, who emerged as president in July 1912, was the primary figure in the partnership with Dintenfass, Baumann, Kessel, Powers, Swanson, Horsley, and Brulatour. Eventually all would be bought out by Laemmle. The new Universal studio was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration" title="Vertical integration">vertically integrated company</a>, with movie production, distribution and exhibition venues all linked in the same corporate entity, the central element of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system" title="Studio system">Studio system</a> era.</p>
<p>Following the westward trend of the industry, by the end of 1912 the company was focusing its production efforts in the Hollywood area.</p>
<p>On March 15, 1915,<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-Universal_Story-9">[8]</a></sup><sup style="white-space: nowrap;" class="reference">:8</sup> Laemmle opened the world's largest motion picture production facility, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios_Hollywood" title="Universal Studios Hollywood">Universal City Studios</a>, on a 230-acre (0.9-km²) converted farm just over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahuenga_Pass" title="Cahuenga Pass">Cahuenga Pass</a> from Hollywood. Studio management became the third facet of Universal's operations, with the studio incorporated as a distinct subsidiary organization. Unlike other movie moguls, Laemmle opened his studio to tourists. Universal became the largest studio in Hollywood, and remained so for a decade. However, it sought an audience mostly in small towns, producing mostly inexpensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama" title="Melodrama">melodramas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">westerns</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_film" title="Serial film">serials</a>.</p>
<p>In its early years Universal released three brands of feature films — Red Feather, low-budget programmers; Bluebird, more ambitious productions; and Jewel, their prestige motion pictures. Directors included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Conway_(filmmaker)" title="Jack Conway (filmmaker)">Jack Conway</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Ingram_(director)" title="Rex Ingram (director)">Rex Ingram</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Z._Leonard" title="Robert Z. Leonard">Robert Z. Leonard</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall_(director)" title="George Marshall (director)">George Marshall</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Weber" title="Lois Weber">Lois Weber</a>, one of the few women directing films in Hollywood.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-Universal_Story-9">[8]</a></sup><sup style="white-space: nowrap;" class="reference">:13</sup></p>
<p>Despite Laemmle's role as an innovator, he was an extremely cautious studio chief. Unlike rivals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Zukor" title="Adolph Zukor">Adolph Zukor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fox_(producer)" title="William Fox (producer)">William Fox</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Loew" title="Marcus Loew">Marcus Loew</a>, Laemmle chose not to develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_chain" title="Theater chain" class="mw-redirect">theater chain</a>. He also financed all of his own films, refusing to take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Stroheim" title="Erich von Stroheim">Erich von Stroheim</a> insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Husbands" title="Blind Husbands">Blind Husbands</a> (1919) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foolish_Wives" title="Foolish Wives">Foolish Wives</a> (1922), but Universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_campaign" title="Ad campaign" class="mw-redirect">ad campaign</a> that attracted moviegoers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor" title="Character actor">Character actor</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Chaney,_Sr." title="Lon Chaney, Sr." class="mw-redirect">Lon Chaney</a> became a drawing card for Universal in the 1920s, appearing steadily in dramas. His two biggest hits for Universal were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_(1923_film)" title="The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a> (1923) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1925_film)" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)">The Phantom of the Opera</a> (1925). During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>. Thalberg had been Laemmle's personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated. Promoted to studio chief, Thalberg was giving Universal's product a touch of class, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM" class="mw-redirect">MGM</a>'s head of production <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay. Without his guidance Universal became a second-tier studio, and would remain so for several decades.</p>
<p>In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pasternak" title="Joe Pasternak">Joe Pasternak</a>. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler" title="Hitler" class="mw-redirect">Hitler</a>'s increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.</p>
<p>In the early years, Universal had a "clean picture" policy. However, by April 1927, Carl Laemmle considered this to be a mistake as "unclean pictures" from other studios were generating more profit while Universal was losing money.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-10">[</a></sup></p>]]></history>
