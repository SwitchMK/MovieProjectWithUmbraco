        <plot><![CDATA[<p>In 1926, British wizard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them#About_Newt_Scamander" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Newt Scamander</a> arrives by boat to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> en route to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman ("No-Maj" or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">muggle</a>") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society, which claims that witches and wizards are real and dangerous. As Newt listens to her speak, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Beasts" title="Magical creatures in Harry Potter">Niffler</a> escapes from his magically-expanded suitcase, which houses multiple magical creatures. As he attempts to capture it, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski and they accidentally swap suitcases. Demoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auror" title="Auror" class="mw-redirect">Auror</a> Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, President Seraphina Picquery and Director of the Magical Security Percival Graves dismiss the case. At Jacob's apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.</p>
<p>Graves approaches Credence Barebone, Mary Lou's adopted son, and offers to free him from his abusive mother in exchange for his finding the host of an Obscurus, a dark, destructive force inadvertently manifested by young magical children forced to conceal their powers. The force can be unleashed during periods of anger and stress; Graves believes that it has caused several mysterious destructive incidents around the city.</p>
<p>After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Legilimency_and_Occlumency" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Legilimens</a> sister. Queenie and Jacob are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to marry No-Majs or interact with them. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically-expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained Obscurus that Newt recently extracted from a girl who died. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After re-capturing two of the three escaped beasts, they re-enter the suitcase, which Tina takes to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> Henry Shaw Jr., and decide to destroy Newt's suitcase and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obliviate" title="Obliviate" class="mw-redirect">obliviate</a> Jacob's memory. Graves interrogates Newt and Tina and accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Dark_Arts" title="Magic in Harry Potter">dark wizard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supporting_Harry_Potter_characters#Gellert_Grindelwald" title="List of supporting Harry Potter characters">Gellert Grindelwald</a>. Newt and Tina are immediately sentenced to death, but they escape and meet up with Queenie and Jacob; the foursome then capture the last of the creatures after receiving a tip from the goblin gangster Gnarlack.</p>
<p>Credence finds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Wand" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">wand</a> under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes the wand is Credence's, but Modesty claims it is hers. When she is about to be punished, the Obscurus is unleashed, killing everyone except Modesty and Credence. Graves arrives and dismisses Credence as being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe_of_Harry_Potter#Squibs" title="Fictional universe of Harry Potter">Squib</a> (a non-magical person of wizard ancestry), and refuses to tutor him in magic after they enter Modesty's biological family's home. Credence then reveals himself as the host of the Obscurus, the real cause of Shaw's death, and unleashes it upon the city in a rage.</p>
<p>In a subway tunnel, Newt talks to Credence but is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him instead. As Credence begins to settle into human form, Picquery arrives with Aurors and decides Credence's life must be forfeited to keep the existence of magic hidden. The Aurors apparently disintegrate him, but Newt notices a tiny wisp of the Obscurus fleeing. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. He repels the Aurors but is subdued by one of Newt's beasts and revealed to be Gellert Grindelwald in disguise. Grindelwald is then taken into custody by MACUSA Aurors.</p>
<p>MACUSA fears it is too late to protect their secret world, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a potion over the city via a downpour that will erase all New Yorkers' recent memories. MACUSA wizards repair the destruction, and Jacob reluctantly agrees to let himself be obliviated as well. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories. Newt departs for Europe, but promises to return and visit Tina once he finishes his book; he also anonymously leaves Jacob a case of Occamy eggshells (made of silver), allowing Jacob to fulfil his dream of opening his own bakery. His breads and pastries are unknowingly inspired by Newt's creatures, and Queenie visits him in his shop.</p>]]></plot>

        <plot><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter</a> spends the summer without receiving letters from his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a> friends. In his room, Harry meets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_creatures_(Harry_Potter)#Dobby" title="Magical creatures (Harry Potter)" class="mw-redirect">Dobby</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf" class="mw-redirect">house-elf</a> who warns him bad things will happen if he returns to Hogwarts, and reveals he intercepted his friends' letters. Harry chases him downstairs, where Dobby destroys a cake. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dursleys" title="The Dursleys" class="mw-redirect">The Dursleys</a> lock Harry up, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_and_George_Weasley" title="Fred and George Weasley" class="mw-redirect">Fred and George Weasley</a> rescue him in their father's flying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Anglia" title="Ford Anglia">Ford Anglia</a>.</p>
<p>While buying school supplies, Harry and the Weasley family encounter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, and they attend a book-signing by celebrity wizard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart" class="mw-redirect">Gilderoy Lockhart</a>, who announces he will be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry also encounters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> and his father <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy" class="mw-redirect">Lucius</a>, who slips a book in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley" class="mw-redirect">Ginny Weasley</a>'s belongings. When Harry and Ron are blocked from entering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Nine_and_Three-Quarters" title="Platform Nine and Three-Quarters" class="mw-redirect">Platform Nine and Three-Quarters</a> (later revealed to be Dobby's doing), they fly to Hogwarts in the Ford Anglia and crash into the hostile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whomping_Willow" title="Whomping Willow" class="mw-redirect">Whomping Willow</a>. Ron's wand is damaged, and the car throws them out before driving off. They are allowed back into school but face detention.</p>
<p>While serving detention with Lockhart, Harry hears strange voices and later finds caretaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch" class="mw-redirect">Argus Filch</a>'s cat, Mrs. Norris, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrifaction_in_mythology_and_fiction" title="Petrifaction in mythology and fiction">petrified</a>, and a message written in blood announcing the "Chamber of Secrets has been opened, Enemies of the Heir, beware". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall" class="mw-redirect">Professor McGonagall</a> explains that one of Hogwarts' founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber and placed inside it a monster that only his Heir can control, to purge the school of impure-blooded wizards and witches. More attacks occur over the course of the year. Harry and Ron suspect Malfoy is the Heir, so Hermione suggests they question him while disguised using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyjuice_potion" title="Polyjuice potion" class="mw-redirect">polyjuice potion</a>. Their makeshift laboratory is in a disused bathroom haunted by a ghost, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moaning_Myrtle" title="Moaning Myrtle" class="mw-redirect">Moaning Myrtle</a>.</p>
<p>When Harry communicates with a snake (something Salazar Slytherin could do) the school suspects him as the Heir. At Christmas, Harry and Ron learn that Malfoy is not the Heir, but he mentions that a girl died when the Chamber was last opened fifty years ago. Harry finds an enchanted diary, owned by a former student named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle" class="mw-redirect">Tom Riddle</a>, which shows him a flashback to fifty years before, where Riddle accused Hagrid, then a student, of opening the Chamber. When the diary disappears and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Professor Dumbledore</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge" class="mw-redirect">Cornelius Fudge</a>, and Lucius Malfoy come to take Hagrid to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban" class="mw-redirect">Azkaban</a>, but he discreetly tells the boys to "follow the spiders". Lucius has Dumbledore suspended. In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog" class="mw-redirect">Aragog</a>, a giant spider who reveals Hagrid's innocence and that the dead girl was found in a bathroom. Aragog then sets his colony of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula" class="mw-redirect">Acromantula</a> on the boys, but the now-wild Ford Anglia saves them.</p>
<p>A book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilisk_(Harry_Potter)" title="Basilisk (Harry Potter)" class="mw-redirect">basilisk</a>, a giant serpent that instantly kills those who make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims saw it indirectly. The school staff learn that Ginny was taken into the Chamber, and convince Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart, exposed as a fraud, planning to flee; knowing Myrtle was the girl the Basilisk killed, they drag him to her bathroom and find the Chamber's entrance. Once inside, Lockhart uses Ron's damaged wand against them, but it backfires, wiping his memory, and causes a cave-in.</p>
<p>Harry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious and dying guarded by Tom Riddle. Harry realises Riddle is the Heir and he used the diary to manipulate Ginny and reopen the Chamber. Riddle then reveals his full name, Tom Marvolo Riddle, from which he created the anagram for his future new identity, "I am Lord Voldemort". After Harry expresses support for Dumbledore, Dumbledore's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_creatures_(Harry_Potter)#Fawkes" title="Magical creatures (Harry Potter)" class="mw-redirect">Fawkes</a> flies in with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat" class="mw-redirect">Sorting Hat</a>, and Riddle summons the Basilisk. Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, and the Sorting Hat eventually produces a sword with which Harry battles and slays the Basilisk, but he is poisoned by its fangs.</p>
<p>Harry defeats Riddle and revives Ginny by stabbing the diary with a basilisk fang. Fawkes' tears heal him, and he returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. Dumbledore, reinstated as headmaster, praises them and orders for Hagrid's release. Dumbledore shows Harry that the sword he wielded was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_of_Gryffindor" title="Sword of Gryffindor" class="mw-redirect">Godric Gryffindor's own sword</a>, and says he is different from Voldemort because he chose Gryffindor House instead of Slytherin House. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby's master, of putting the diary in Ginny's cauldron and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The Basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid returns.</p>]]></plot>

        <plot><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter is a seemingly ordinary boy, living with his neglectful relatives the Dursleys, in Surrey, England. On his eleventh birthday Harry discovers from a mysterious stranger, Rubeus Hagrid, that he is actually a wizard, famous in the Wizarding World for surviving an attack by the evil Lord Voldemort when Harry was only a baby. Voldemort killed Harry's parents, but his attack on Harry rebounded leaving only a lightning-bolt scar on Harry's forehead and rendering Voldemort powerless. Hagrid reveals to Harry that he has been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After buying his school supplies from the hidden London street, Diagon Alley, Harry boards the train to Hogwarts via the concealed Platform 9¾ in King's Cross Station.<br />On the train Harry meets Ron Weasley, a boy from a large but poor pure-blood wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a witch born to non-magical parents. Once they arrive Harry and all the other first-year students are sorted between four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Because Slytherin is noted for being the house of darker wizards and witches, Harry convinces the Sorting Hat not to put him in Slytherin. He ends up in Gryffindor along with Ron and Hermione. Ron's older brothers were all placed in Gryffindor as well: mischievous twins Fred and George, Percy the prefect, Charlie (who researches dragons in Romania) and Bill (who works for Gringotts Bank).<br />At Hogwarts Harry begins learning wizardry and discovers more about his past and his parents. He gets recruited for Gryffindor's Quidditch (a sport in the wizarding world where people fly on broomsticks) team as a Seeker, as his father was before him. One night he, Ron, and Hermione discover a large three-headed dog named Fluffy (owned by Hagrid) on a restricted floor in the school. They later find out Fluffy is guarding the Philosopher's Stone, an item that can be used to grant its owner immortality. Harry concludes that his potions teacher, the unfriendly Severus Snape, is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort (who Harry encounters in the Forbidden Forest where he, Ron, Hermione, and Draco Malfoy are serving detention by helping Hagrid look for an injured unicorn after being caught wandering around at night) to a human form.<br />After hearing from Hagrid that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music, Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to find the stone before Snape does. They face a series of tasks that are helping guard the stone which include surviving a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, flying past a swarm of bird-shaped flying keys and winning a dangerous, life-sized chess game.<br />After getting past the tasks Harry discovers that it was really Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Quirrell who was trying to steal the stone, and that Snape was protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals Voldemort to be living on the back of his head. Voldemort attempts to convince Harry to give him the stone (which Harry suddenly finds in his pocket as the result of an enchantment by the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore), by promising to bring his parents back from the dead, but Harry refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill him but Harry's touch prevents Quirrell from hurting Harry and causes his hand to turn to dust. Quirrell then attempts to take the stone but Harry grabs his face causing Quirrell to turn into dust and die. When Harry gets up Voldemort's spirit forms and passes through Harry knocking him unconscious before fleeing.<br />Harry wakes up in the school's hospital wing with Professor Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that, despite Ron nearly being killed in the chess match, he and Hermione are both fine. The reason Quirrell burned at Harry's touch was because when Harry's mother died to save him her death gave Harry a magical, love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, and Neville Longbottom is rewarded for bravely standing up to them, winning Gryffindor the House Cup. Before Harry and the rest of the students leave for the summer, Harry realises that while all other students are going home, Hogwarts is truly his home.</p>]]></plot>

        <plot><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter, now aged 13, has been spending another dissatisfying summer at Privet Drive. When Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge, insults Harry's parents, he becomes angry and accidentally causes her to inflate and float away. Harry flees with his luggage, fed up with his life with the Dursleys. The Knight Bus delivers Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where he is forgiven by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge for using magic outside of Hogwarts. After reuniting with his best friends Ron and Hermione, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a convicted supporter of the dark wizard Voldemort, who murdered Harry's parents, has escaped Azkaban prison, intending to kill Harry.<br />The trio are returning to Hogwarts for the school year on the Hogwarts Express when dementors suddenly board the train, searching for Sirius. One enters the trio's compartment, causing Harry to pass out. New Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin repels the dementor with a Patronus Charm. At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that dementors will be guarding the school while Sirius is at large. Hogwarts groundskeeper Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher; his first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes a hippogriff, Buckbeak, who attacks him. Draco's father Lucius Malfoy later has Buckbeak sentenced to death.<br />The Fat Lady's portrait, which guards the Gryffindor quarters, is found ruined and empty. Terrified and hiding in another painting, the Fat Lady tells Dumbledore that Sirius Black has entered the castle. During a stormy Quidditch match, dementors attack Harry, causing him to fall off his broomstick, which is then destroyed by the Whomping Willow. At Hogsmeade, Harry is shocked to learn that not only had Sirius Black been his parents' best friend and betrayed them to Voldemort, but that Sirius is also his godfather. Lupin privately teaches Harry to defend himself against dementors, using the Patronus Charm.<br />After Harry, Ron and Hermione witness Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat Scabbers bites him and escapes. When Ron gives chase, a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the Whomping Willow's base, which is actually an underground passage to the Shrieking Shack. The trio discovers that the dog is actually Sirius, who is an Animagus. Lupin arrives and embraces Sirius as an old friend. He admits to being a werewolf, and explains that Sirius is innocent. Sirius was falsely accused of betraying James and Lily to Voldemort, and murdering their mutual friend Peter Pettigrew. It is revealed that Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, an Animagus who committed the crime for which Sirius was convicted. After forcing him back into a human, Lupin and Sirius prepare to kill him, but Harry convinces them to turn Pettigrew over to the dementors.<br />As the group departs, the full moon rises; Lupin transforms into a werewolf, and Sirius transforms into his dog form to fight him off. In the chaos, Pettigrew escapes in his rat form. Sirius and Harry are attacked by dementors and Harry sees a figure in the distance save them by casting a powerful Patronus spell. He believes the mysterious figure is his dead father, and passes out. He awakens to discover that Sirius has been captured and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss. Acting on Dumbledore's advice, Harry and Hermione travel back in time with Hermione's Time Turner, and watch themselves and Ron repeat the night's events. They save Buckbeak from execution and witness the Dementors overpower Sirius and Harry. The present Harry realises that it was actually him who conjured the Patronus, and does so again. Harry and Hermione then rescue Sirius, who escapes on Buckbeak. Lupin resigns to preempt an uproar from parents over a werewolf teaching their children. Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, the fastest broom in the world, and Harry happily takes it for a ride.</p>]]></plot>

Harry attends the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys, but after the game Death Eaters terrorise the spectators, and the man who appeared in Harry's dream summons the Dark Mark.<br />At Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore introduces ex-Auror Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He also announces that the school will host the legendary event known as Triwizard Tournament, in which three magical schools compete against each other in a very deadly competition by facing three dangerous challenges. The Goblet of Fire selects "champions" to take part in the competition: Cedric Diggory of Hufflepuff representing Hogwarts, Viktor Krum representing Durmstrang Institute, and Fleur Delacour representing Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. The Goblet unexpectedly also chooses a fourth champion: Harry Potter. Dumbfounded, Dumbledore is unable to pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as the Ministry official Barty Crouch Sr. insists that the champions are bound by a contract, and therefore, Harry is invited to compete. This makes Harry's best friend Ron Weasley jealous of him.<br />For the tournament's first task, the champions must each retrieve a golden egg guarded by a dragon. After summoning his broomstick, Harry succeeds in retrieving his egg, which contains information about the second challenge. Shortly after, another event known as the Yule Ball dance takes place; Harry's crush Cho Chang attends with Cedric, and Hermione Granger attends with Viktor, which makes Ron jealous of Viktor. During the second task, the champions must dive underwater to rescue their mates. Harry comes out in third place, but is placed second behind Cedric due to his "moral fiber". Afterwards, Harry finds the corpse of Barty Crouch Sr. Harry visits Dumbledore at his office, and while waiting for him, he discovers a Pensieve, which holds Dumbledore's memories. Inside it, Harry witnesses a trial in which Igor Karkaroff (Durmstrang Institute's Headmaster) confessed to the Ministry of Magic names of other Death Eaters, after Voldemort's defeat. He named Severus Snape as one, but Dumbledore defended him; he then named Barty Crouch Jr. This left Barty Crouch Sr. devastated, and his son was imprisoned in Azkaban. After exiting the Pensieve, Harry deduces that the man he has seen in his dreams with Voldemort is Barty Crouch Jr.<br />In the third and final task, the champions enter a hedge maze and must reach the Triwizard Cup. Viktor, under the influence of the Imperius Curse, incapacitates Fleur. After Harry saves Cedric when the maze attacks him, the two claim a draw and together grab the cup, which turns out to be a Portkey and transports the two to a graveyard, where Pettigrew and Voldemort are waiting. Pettigrew kills Cedric with the Killing Curse and performs a ritual using a bone of Voldemort's father, Pettigrew's flesh and Harry's blood, which rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters. Voldemort releases Harry in order to beat him in a duel to prove he is the better wizard. Harry, unable to defend himself, tries the Expelliarmus charm at the same moment that Voldemort attempts the Killing Curse. Their wands do not work against each other, and Voldemort's wand is forced to disgorge the last spells it performed. This results in shadow impressions of the people he murdered appearing in the graveyard, including Harry's parents and Cedric. This provides an ample distraction to Voldemort and his Death Eaters, allowing Harry to escape with Cedric's body by grabbing the Portkey.<br />Upon his return, Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort has returned and is responsible for Cedric's death. Moody takes a devastated Harry back to his room to interrogate him about Lord Voldemort, where he inadvertently blows his cover when he asks Harry whether there were "others" in the graveyard - despite Harry never having mentioned a graveyard. Exposed, Moody reveals that he had submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire, and that he had been guiding and manipulating Harry throughout the tournament to ensure that he would win, so Voldemort would take Harry's blood in order to return. Moody then tries to kill Harry, only for Harry to be saved by Dumbledore, Severus Snape, and Minerva McGonagall. The teachers force Moody to drink Veritaserum, a truth-telling potion, which reveals that he is not Moody, and that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk. The false Moody's Polyjuice Potion wears off and he is revealed as Barty Crouch Jr., working for Voldemort. Crouch Jr. is sent back to Azkaban, from which he had escaped.<br />In the morning, Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes the revelation. Later, Dumbledore visits Harry in his dormitory, and apologizes to him for the dangers he had to go through. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "Priori Incantatem". Dumbledore acknowledges that even though Harry's parents appeared through Voldemort's wand, no spell can awaken the dead. Dumbledore reminds Harry that he is not alone. Soon after, Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons bid farewell to each other.</p>]]></plot>

        <plot><![CDATA[<p>The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore, informs Harry Potter that the Ministry of Magic is oblivious to Lord Voldemort's return. While at the Order's headquarters, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort is after an object he did not have during his previous attack.<br />Upon arrival at Hogwarts, Harry learns that Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: Dolores Umbridge. She and Harry immediately clash, and she punishes Harry for his "lies" by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. When Ron and Hermione notice Harry's scars, they are outraged but he refuses to go to Dumbledore, who has distanced himself from Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves "Dumbledore's Army". The Slytherin students are recruited by Umbridge to expose the group. Meanwhile, Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other .<br />Harry has a vision involving an attack upon Arthur Weasley, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Severus Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' deranged cousin, escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry's relationship with Cho falls apart, as he believes she betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge. Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape hated Harry's father James, who often ridiculed him.<br />Harry has another vision, this one of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network, since hers is the only fireplace not being monitored, but Umbridge stops them before they can do so. As Umbridge tortures Harry, Hermione tricks Umbridge into entering the Forbidden Forest in search of Dumbledore's "secret weapon". She and Harry lead her to the hiding place of Hagrid's giant half-brother, Grawp, only to be confronted by centaurs who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks and insults them. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals in an attempt to save Sirius.<br />The six enter the Department of Mysteries where they uncover a bottled prophecy, the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured; it was simply a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters take everyone except Harry as hostages, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy.<br />Harry obliges just as Sirius and Remus Lupin arrive with Order members Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody. As they attack the Death Eaters, Lucius drops the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before Voldemort can kill Harry.<br />A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, destroying much of the Atrium, while Bellatrix escapes. After the two prove evenly matched, Voldemort possesses Harry to try to get Dumbledore to sacrifice Harry, but the love Harry feels for his friends and Sirius makes it impossible for Voldemort to remain in his body. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort disapparates; Fudge is forced to admit that Voldemort has returned and resigns as Minister in disgrace. Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts and Dumbledore returns as headmaster. Dumbledore explains he distanced himself from Harry throughout the year hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection. Harry comes to terms with the prophecy; "Neither can live while the other survives."</p>]]></plot>

        <plot><![CDATA[<p>Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the wizarding and Muggle worlds and has chosen Draco Malfoy to carry out a secret mission. Severus Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Draco's mother, Narcissa, to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.<br />16-year-old Harry accompanies Albus Dumbledore to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn, who has gone into hiding but agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to the Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, after seeing Draco taking part in a ceremony, but Ron and Hermione are skeptical. At Hogwarts, Harry and Ron are forced to borrow textbooks for Slughorn's Potions class, and Harry is stuck with a copy that turns out to be filled with helpful notes, instructions, and spells left by the book's previous owner, the "Half-Blood Prince". Using the book, Harry excels in the class and impresses Slughorn. Ron becomes Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team and forms a romantic relationship with Lavender Brown, upsetting Hermione. Harry consoles Hermione, revealing that he now has feelings for Ron's younger sister, Ginny Weasley.<br />Harry spends the Christmas holidays with the Weasleys. On Christmas Eve, Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback set fire to the Burrow. Back at school, Ron is nearly killed when he drinks poisoned mead, a drink originally intended for Dumbledore. While recovering, Ron murmurs Hermione's name, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco and severely injures him with a Sectumsempra curse taken from the textbook of the Half-Blood Prince. Snape enters and quickly heals Draco's wound. Fearing the book may be filled with more Dark Magic, Ginny and Harry hide it in the Room of Requirement and share their first kiss.<br />Dumbledore shows Harry memories of a young Tom Riddle and reveals that Slughorn retains a memory critical to Voldemort's defeat. Harry eventually succeeds in retrieving the memory, and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating Horcruxes, objects that contain pieces of his soul. In the memory, Tom asked if dividing his soul into seven pieces was possible. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort eventually did this, and two of his Horcruxes have already been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary and his mother's ring. After discovering the possible location of another Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore travel to a seaside cave where Harry is forced to make Dumbledore drink a painful potion that hides the Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. A weakened Dumbledore defends them from Inferi and apparates back to Hogwarts, where Bellatrix, Greyback and more Death Eaters have entered with Draco's help through a Vanishing Cabinet.<br />Dumbledore instructs Harry to hide as Draco arrives, disarms Dumbledore and reveals that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill the headmaster. However, he is unable to bring himself to do it, and Snape casts the Avada Kedavra curse instead, killing Dumbledore. Harry attempts to curse Snape, but Snape overpowers him and reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince. Harry returns to the school to find the staff and students mourning Dumbledore. Harry later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from "R.A.B.", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. Rather than return for their final year at Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to seek out and destroy the remaining Horcruxes.</p>]]></plot>

        <plot><![CDATA[<p>The Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, addresses the wizarding media, stating that the Ministry will remain strong even as Lord Voldemort gains strength. Harry, Ron and Hermione prepare for a journey to find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, with Harry watching the Dursleys depart and Hermione wiping her parents' memories of her.<br />Severus Snape arrives at Malfoy Manor to inform Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters of Harry's impending departure from No. 4 Privet Drive. Voldemort commandeers Lucius Malfoy's wand, as Voldemort's own wand cannot be used to kill Harry, because the wands are "twins."<br />Meanwhile, the Order of the Phoenix gather at Privet Drive and escort Harry to safety, using Polyjuice Potion to create six decoy Harrys out of everyone else. During their flight to the Weasley family home at the Burrow, all are ambushed by Death Eaters. They kill Mad-Eye Moody and Harry's owl, Hedwig, injure George Weasley, and knock out Hagrid. This forces Harry to take over and drive his flying motorbike while fighting Voldemort. In the process, destroying some power lines that causes a blackout to the city. After arriving at the Burrow, Harry has a vision of the wand-maker Ollivander being tormented by Voldemort, who claims that Ollivander had lied to him. Ollivander claimed that the only way Voldemort could kill Harry was by using another person's wand.<br />Scrimgeour arrives at the Burrow with Albus Dumbledore's Will and distributes three items to Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Ron receives Dumbledore's Deluminator, Hermione a copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Harry the first Golden Snitch that he ever caught in a Quidditch match. Scrimgeour reveals that Harry was also bequeathed the Sword of Godric Gryffindor. The minister states, though, that the sword was not Dumbledore's to pass on and, in any case, is missing.<br />Next, the Death Eaters assassinate Scrimgeour and replace him with their puppet Pius Thicknesse. Thicknesse, under the influence of the Imperius curse, begins persecuting Muggle-born witches and wizards. Then the Minister disrupts the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour, by sending a patronus charm to tell everyone what they did and attack them. Harry, Hermione, and Ron Disapparate to London and find sanctuary at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. There they discover that the "R.A.B." from the false Horcrux locket is Regulus Arcturus Black, the younger brother of Sirius Black. Kreacher, the Black's house-elf, tells them that Mundungus Fletcher stole the real locket. Kreacher and Dobby apprehend Fletcher, who reveals that the locket is in the possession of Dolores Umbridge. Under the disguise of Polyjuice Potion, the trio infiltrate the Ministry. In the courtroom, Umbridge is interrogating a Muggle-born witch and threatens her, which enrages Harry, who says to her "You're lying, Dolores. And one mustn't tell lies." He then stuns her and Hermione successfully retrieves the locket. The trio escape from the Dementors by fleeing into the wilderness after accidentally revealing the location of No. 12 Grimmauld Place to Yaxley, a Death Eater.<br />Unable to destroy the Horcrux, they take turns wearing it to dilute its malignant power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating Gregorovitch, a renowned wand-maker, who claims that a teenage boy had once stolen the legendary Elder Wand from his shop. While Ron wears the locket, he is overcome by his negative feelings and after arguing with Harry, he leaves, upsetting Hermione. Harry and Hermione decide to go to Godric's Hollow, where they visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. Next Harry and Hermoine visit Bathilda Bagshot, who they believe has the Sword of Gryffindor, which they deduce can destroy Horcruxes. They are surprised by Voldemort's snake, Nagini, who has been possessing her corpse. Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand as they escape into the Forest of Dean. Hermione is able to identify the mysterious thief seen in Harry's vision as Gellert Grindelwald.<br />When evening falls, Harry sees a Patronus in the form of a doe which leads him to a frozen pond. Gryffindor's sword lies beneath the pond's ice. Harry breaks the ice and jumps in to reach the sword. The locket around his neck attempts to strangle him, but Ron arrives to rescue Harry. Despite the soul inside the locket attacking both of them, Ron manages to destroy it with the Sword of Gryffindor. Hermione is angry with Ron at first but then reconciles with him.<br />The trio then visit Xenophilius Lovegood to learn about a symbol seen several times on their journey. He tells them that the symbol represents the Deathly Hallows: the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility. Lovegood betrays them to the Death Eaters in an effort to have his kidnapped daughter returned.<br />The trio escape into the wilderness once more, but Snatchers appear and chase them. Harry has a vision of Voldemort learning from Grindelwald that the Elder Wand lies with Dumbledore in his grave. They are then captured and taken to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in a cellar, in which they discover Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor. After Dobby apparates in the cellar to save them, and incapacitates Peter Pettigrew, a short battle ensues; Harry duels and disarms Draco Malfoy. Narcissa Malfoy's wand is taken by Dobby who says "Dobby has no master. Dobby is a free elf. And Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends." Dobby is killed by Bellatrix right after he helps Harry and the other captives escape. Meanwhile, Voldemort breaks into Dumbledore's tomb and takes the Elder Wand.</p>]]></plot>

        <plot><![CDATA[<p>After burying Dobby, Harry Potter asks the goblin Griphook to help him, Ron, and Hermione break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting a Horcrux may be there. Griphook agrees, in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and to Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.<br />In Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort killing goblins, including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at Hogwarts somehow connected to Rowena Ravenclaw. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade, where Aberforth Dumbledore reluctantly instructs the portrait of his deceased younger sister, Ariana, to fetch Neville Longbottom, who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.<br />Severus Snape hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after Minerva McGonagall challenges him to a duel. McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At Luna Lovegood's insistence, Harry speaks to Helena Ravenclaw's ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed "dark magic" on her mother's diadem, which is in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron and Hermione destroy the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle attack Harry after he finds the diadem, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse and, unable to control it, is swallowed up by the flames while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement, where it is destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. After entering the Hogwarts' Boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort incorrectly telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies since he killed its last owner (Dumbledore); he then orders Nagini to kill Snape, which Nagini does. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the Pensieve. In the chaos at Hogwarts, Fred, Lupin, and Tonks have been killed.<br />Harry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, he loved his late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked secretly with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all.<br />Voldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands they all surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is still alive. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall, and Neville decapitates Nagini, leaving Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding, killing and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore, but instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and discards it.<br />Nineteen years later, Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Draco proudly watch their own children leave for Hogwarts at King's Cross station.</p>]]></plot>

        <fullName><![CDATA[Daniel Jacob Radcliffe]]></fullName>
        <biography><![CDATA[<p>Radcliffe was born in Queen Charlotte's Hospital, Hammersmith, London, England. He is the only child of Alan George Radcliffe, a literary agent, and Marcia Jeannine Gresham (née Marcia Gresham Jacobson), a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC, including The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Walk Away and I Stumble. His father, who was raised in Banbridge, County Down, Northern Ireland, is from "a very working-class" Protestant background. His mother is Jewish, and was born in South Africa and raised in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia. Radcliffe's parents had both acted as children.<br />In a 2012 interview, Radcliffe stated: "There was never [religious] faith in the house. I think of myself as being Jewish and Irish, despite the fact that I'm English." He has stated: "We were Christmas tree Jews", and that he is "very proud of being Jewish".<br />Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at the age of five, and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy. He was educated at two independent schools for boys: Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it was people just trying to "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" rather than jealousy.<br />As his acting career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe continued his education through on-set tutors. He admitted he was not very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work "really difficult." He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write, and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience. "The paparazzi, they'd love it," he told Details magazine in 2007. "If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were."</p>]]></biography>

<p>Kloves, born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas" title="Austin, Texas">Austin</a>, Texas, grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnyvale,_California" title="Sunnyvale, California">Sunnyvale</a>, California, where he graduated from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_High_School_(Sunnyvale,_California)" title="Fremont High School (Sunnyvale, California)">Fremont High School</a>. He attended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="University of California, Los Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a> but dropped out when he was not admitted into the film school in his third year. As an unpaid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intern" title="Intern" class="mw-redirect">intern</a> for a Hollywood agent, he gained attention for a screenplay he wrote called Swings. This led to a meeting where he successfully pitched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_with_the_Moon" title="Racing with the Moon">Racing with the Moon</a> (1984).</p>
<p>His first experience with professional screenwriting left him wanting more interaction with the actors so that the characters would stay true to his vision. Kloves wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabulous_Baker_Boys" title="The Fabulous Baker Boys">The Fabulous Baker Boys</a> and also intended it to be his directorial debut. After years of trying to sell the project in Hollywood, the film finally got off the ground and was released in 1989. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabulous_Baker_Boys" title="The Fabulous Baker Boys">The Fabulous Baker Boys</a> did reasonably well, but his next shot as writer/director for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh_and_Bone_(film)" title="Flesh and Bone (film)">Flesh and Bone</a> in 1993 fared poorly at the box office. Kloves then stopped writing for three years.</p>
<p>Realizing that he had to return to writing to support his family, he began adapting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chabon" title="Michael Chabon">Michael Chabon</a>'s novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boys_(film)" title="Wonder Boys (film)">Wonder Boys</a> into a screenplay. Kloves was offered the chance to direct but he declined, preferring to direct only his own original work. This was his first try at adapting another work to film. His screenplay was nominated for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe" class="mw-redirect">Golden Globe</a> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award" class="mw-redirect">Academy Award</a> after the film's release in 2000.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> sent Kloves a list of novels that the company was considering to adapt as films. The listing included the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone">first Harry Potter novel</a>, which intrigued him despite his usual indifference to these catalogs. He went on to write the screenplays for the first four films in the series. However, he turned down writing the fifth film, stating that "The fourth film, Goblet of Fire, was really hard to do. I wrote on it for two years. But it’s not that simple and I don’t know that I’ll ever fully understand why I didn’t do it." After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Goldenberg" title="Michael Goldenberg">Michael Goldenberg</a> wrote the screenplay for the fifth film, Kloves then returned to write the sixth, seventh and eighth installments.</p>
<p>As of 2011, Kloves is working on a film adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Haddon" title="Mark Haddon">Mark Haddon</a>'s novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curious_Incident_of_the_Dog_in_the_Night-Time" title="The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</a>, which he will write and direct. He has also a draft written of the yet unproduced fantasy film Akira.</p>]]></biography>

My father's parents ran a department store in Bangor, Maine, and my mother's father was a cabinetmaker. [...] People with those roots are not inclined to be lazy."</p>
<p>In 1948, the Williams family moved to Los Angeles where John attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_High_School" title="North Hollywood High School">North Hollywood High School</a> graduating in 1950.

Williams never met Fiedler in person but spoke with him by telephone. His arrival as the Pops' new leader in the spring of 1980 allowed him to devote part of the Pops' first PBS broadcast of the season to presenting his new compositions for The Empire Strikes Back. Williams almost ended his tenure with the Pops in 1984.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> Considered a customary practice of opinion, some players hissed while sight-reading a new Williams composition in rehearsal; Williams abruptly left the session and turned in his resignation. He initially cited mounting conflicts with his film composing schedule, but later admitted a perceived lack of discipline in, and respect from, the Pops' ranks, culminating in this latest instance. After entreaties by the management and personal apologies from the musicians, Williams withdrew his resignation and continued as principal conductor for nine more years.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams#cite_note-NYT2_JW-61">[61]</a></sup> In 1995, he was succeeded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Lockhart" title="Keith Lockhart">Keith Lockhart</a>, the former associate conductor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Symphony_Orchestra" title="Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra">Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Pops_Orchestra" title="Cincinnati Pops Orchestra">Cincinnati Pops Orchestra</a>.</span></p>

<p>The company's name originated from the four founding Warner brothers (born Wonskolaser or Wonsal before Anglicization):<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Warner" title="Harry Warner">Harry</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Warner" title="Albert Warner">Albert</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Warner" title="Sam Warner">Sam</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_L._Warner" title="Jack L.

They emigrated as small children with their parents to Canada from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnosielc" title="Krasnosielc">Krasnosielc</a> which was located in the part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_Poland" title="Congress Poland">Congress Poland</a> that had been subjugated to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a> following the eighteenth-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland" title="Partitions of Poland">Partitions of Poland</a> near present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostro%C5%82%C4%99ka" title="Ostrołęka">Ostrołęka</a>.</p>
<p>Jack, the youngest, was born in London, Ontario. The three elder brothers began in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater" title="Movie theater">movie theater</a> business, having acquired a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_projector" title="Movie projector">movie projector</a> with which they showed films in the mining towns of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>. In the beginning,<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Sam and Albert Warner invested $150 to present <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_an_American_Fireman" title="Life of an American Fireman">Life of an American Fireman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Train_Robbery_(1903_film)" title="The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)">The Great Train Robbery</a>. They opened their first theater, the Cascade, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Castle,_Pennsylvania" title="New Castle, Pennsylvania">New Castle, Pennsylvania</a>, in 1903.</p>
<p>When the original building was in danger of being demolished, the modern Warner Bros. called the current building owners, and arranged to save it. The owners noted people across the country had asked them to protect it for its historical significance.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1904, the Warners founded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>-based Duquesne Amusement &amp; Supply Company,<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.#cite_note-firstwarnertheatre.com-10">[10]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> to distribute films. In 1912, Harry Warner hired an auditor named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ashley_Chase" title="Paul Ashley Chase">Paul Ashley Chase</a>. By the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> they had begun producing films.

On April 4, 1923, with help from money loaned to Harry by his banker Motley Flint,<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.#cite_note-p77-12">[12]</a></sup> they formally incorporated as Warner Brothers Pictures, Incorporated. (As late as the 1960s, Warner Bros. claimed 1905 as its founding date.)</p>

        <history><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span id="History" class="mw-headline">History</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Universal Studios was founded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Laemmle" title="Carl Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a>, Mark Dintenfass, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_O_Baumann" title="Charles O Baumann" class="mw-redirect">Charles O. Baumann</a>, Adam Kessel, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Powers_(businessman)" title="Pat Powers (businessman)">Pat Powers</a>, William Swanson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Horsley" title="David Horsley">David Horsley</a>, Robert H. Cochrane<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-3">[a]</a></sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Brulatour" title="Jules Brulatour">Jules Brulatour</a>. One story has Laemmle watching a box office for hours, counting patrons and calculating the day's takings. Within weeks of his Chicago trip, Laemmle gave up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_goods" title="Dry goods">dry goods</a> to buy the first several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_(movie_theater)" title="Nickelodeon (movie theater)">nickelodeons</a>. For Laemmle and other such entrepreneurs, the creation in 1908 of the Edison-backed Motion Picture Trust meant that exhibitors were expected to pay fees for Trust-produced films they showed. Based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latham_Loop" title="Latham Loop" class="mw-redirect">Latham Loop</a> used in cameras and projectors, along with other patents, the Trust collected fees on all aspects of movie production and exhibition, and attempted to enforce a monopoly on distribution.</p>
<p>Soon, Laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying Edison by producing their own pictures. In June 1909, Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Stern" title="Abe Stern">Abe Stern</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Stern_(producer)" title="Julius Stern (producer)">Julius Stern</a>. That company quickly evolved into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Moving_Pictures" title="Independent Moving Pictures">Independent Moving Pictures Company</a> (IMP), with studios in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee,_New_Jersey" title="Fort Lee, New Jersey">Fort Lee, New Jersey</a>, where many early films in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_first_motion_picture_industry" title="America's first motion picture industry" class="mw-redirect">America's first motion picture industry</a> were produced in the early 20th century.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-4">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-5">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-6">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-7">[6]</a></sup> Laemmle broke with Edison's custom of refusing to give <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billing_(filmmaking)" title="Billing (filmmaking)">billing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_credits" title="Motion picture credits">screen credits</a> to performers. By naming the movie stars, he attracted many of the leading players of the time, contributing to the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_system_(filmmaking)" title="Star system (filmmaking)">star system</a>. In 1910, he promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Lawrence" title="Florence Lawrence">Florence Lawrence</a>, formerly known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Biograph_Girl" title="The Biograph Girl">The Biograph Girl</a>", and actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Baggot" title="King Baggot">King Baggot</a>, in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing.</p>
<p>The Universal Film Manufacturing Company was incorporated in New York on April 30, 1912.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-8">[7]</a></sup> Laemmle, who emerged as president in July 1912, was the primary figure in the partnership with Dintenfass, Baumann, Kessel, Powers, Swanson, Horsley, and Brulatour. Eventually all would be bought out by Laemmle. The new Universal studio was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration" title="Vertical integration">vertically integrated company</a>, with movie production, distribution and exhibition venues all linked in the same corporate entity, the central element of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system" title="Studio system">Studio system</a> era.</p>
<p>Following the westward trend of the industry, by the end of 1912 the company was focusing its production efforts in the Hollywood area.</p>
<p>On March 15, 1915,<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-Universal_Story-9">[8]</a></sup><sup style="white-space: nowrap;" class="reference">:8</sup> Laemmle opened the world's largest motion picture production facility, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios_Hollywood" title="Universal Studios Hollywood">Universal City Studios</a>, on a 230-acre (0.9-km²) converted farm just over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahuenga_Pass" title="Cahuenga Pass">Cahuenga Pass</a> from Hollywood. Studio management became the third facet of Universal's operations, with the studio incorporated as a distinct subsidiary organization. Unlike other movie moguls, Laemmle opened his studio to tourists. Universal became the largest studio in Hollywood, and remained so for a decade. However, it sought an audience mostly in small towns, producing mostly inexpensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama" title="Melodrama">melodramas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">westerns</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_film" title="Serial film">serials</a>.</p>
<p>In its early years Universal released three brands of feature films — Red Feather, low-budget programmers; Bluebird, more ambitious productions; and Jewel, their prestige motion pictures. Directors included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Conway_(filmmaker)" title="Jack Conway (filmmaker)">Jack Conway</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Ingram_(director)" title="Rex Ingram (director)">Rex Ingram</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Z._Leonard" title="Robert Z. Leonard">Robert Z. Leonard</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall_(director)" title="George Marshall (director)">George Marshall</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Weber" title="Lois Weber">Lois Weber</a>, one of the few women directing films in Hollywood.<sup class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios#cite_note-Universal_Story-9">[8]</a></sup><sup style="white-space: nowrap;" class="reference">:13</sup></p>
<p>Despite Laemmle's role as an innovator, he was an extremely cautious studio chief. Unlike rivals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Zukor" title="Adolph Zukor">Adolph Zukor</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fox_(producer)" title="William Fox (producer)">William Fox</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Loew" title="Marcus Loew">Marcus Loew</a>, Laemmle chose not to develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_chain" title="Theater chain" class="mw-redirect">theater chain</a>. He also financed all of his own films, refusing to take on debt. This policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor-director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Stroheim" title="Erich von Stroheim">Erich von Stroheim</a> insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Husbands" title="Blind Husbands">Blind Husbands</a> (1919) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foolish_Wives" title="Foolish Wives">Foolish Wives</a> (1922), but Universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_campaign" title="Ad campaign" class="mw-redirect">ad campaign</a> that attracted moviegoers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_actor" title="Character actor">Character actor</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Chaney,_Sr." title="Lon Chaney, Sr." class="mw-redirect">Lon Chaney</a> became a drawing card for Universal in the 1920s, appearing steadily in dramas. His two biggest hits for Universal were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame_(1923_film)" title="The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a> (1923) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1925_film)" title="The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)">The Phantom of the Opera</a> (1925). During this period Laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>. Thalberg had been Laemmle's personal secretary, and Laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated. Promoted to studio chief, Thalberg was giving Universal's product a touch of class, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM" class="mw-redirect">MGM</a>'s head of production <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> lured Thalberg away from Universal with a promise of better pay. Without his guidance Universal became a second-tier studio, and would remain so for several decades.</p>
<p>In 1926, Universal opened a production unit in Germany, Deutsche Universal-Film AG, under the direction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pasternak" title="Joe Pasternak">Joe Pasternak</a>. This unit produced three to four films per year until 1936, migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler" title="Hitler" class="mw-redirect">Hitler</a>'s increasing domination of central Europe. With the advent of sound, these productions were made in the German language or, occasionally, Hungarian or Polish. In the U.S., Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiary's films, but at least some of them were exhibited through other, independent, foreign-language film distributors based in New York, without benefit of English subtitles. Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary.</p>
<p>In the early years, Universal had a "clean picture" policy.
